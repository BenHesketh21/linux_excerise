# Lists and Directories Excerise

Switch Seats with the person you have been paired up with.
You have 5 mins to mix up, rearrange and generally mess around with this file directory.


## Rules
You are only allowed to rename 2 files, no directories.

You must stay within this repo.

You are not allowed to use the rm command


Now, go back to your seat and race each other to get your file system back the way it was.

Who can cause the most carnage? (Without breaking the machine)
