## Overview
These are some scripting tasks. 
See if you can create scripts that do the tasks the excercises ask for. 
Don't forget to give your script executable permissions.

## Exercise 1
Write a script that excepts a username as an input and returns if that username is logged in or not.

## Exercise 2
Write a script that does the following:
```text 
    - Creates a new directory inside your home directory
    - Creates 2 .txt files
    - Moves one of the file outside the directory
    - Renames that file to test1.txt
    - Renames the second file to test2.sh
    - Make test2.sh a script that prints the working directory
    - Execute that script
```
Make this script executable from everywhere.

## Exercise 3
Write a script that takes a url as user input and then returns whether that website exists.

## Exercise 4
Write a script that takes a file as user input and returns whether the file exists and if so, the full path to that file.

## Exercise 5
Write a script that does the following:
```text
- Takes a filename and title as user input
- Creates (if it doesn't exist) a directory named the current month and year
- Creates a markdown file inside that directory with the users filename and the date on the end. 
- While also entering the title and date at the top of the file.
- Stretch Goal: Try and get the script to take you to that directory and stay there.
```
## Exercise 6
Write a script that creates a GCP virtual machine with jenkins installed onto it.
